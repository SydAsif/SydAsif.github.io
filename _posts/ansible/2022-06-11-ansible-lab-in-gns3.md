## Introduction
GNS3 is used by hundreds of thousands of network engineers worldwide to emulate, configure, test and troubleshoot virtual and real networks. GNS3 allows you to run a small topology consisting of only a few devices on your laptop, to those that have many devices hosted on multiple servers or even hosted in the cloud.

GNS3 is open source, free software that you can download from <http://gns3.com>

## Quick Start Requirments

[Install GNS3](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ibe3hgP8gCA&t=4s) if you don't have it and [VMware or virtual box](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=A0DEnMi09LY&t=11s).

### Lab Topology

### Ansible Lab Configuration

In above lab there is an Network-automation node with 02 network interface cards on our network with Ansible already installed. I have to point out that I have removed Ansible in the automation machine and [installed Ansible 2.9.9 with pip3](https://sydasif.github.io/ansible/ansible-basic/), sshpass and changed IP Address configurations as shown below:

```console
# Static config for eth0
#auto eth0
#iface eth0 inet static
#       address 192.168.0.2
#       netmask 255.255.255.0
#       gateway 192.168.0.1
#       up echo nameserver 192.168.0.1 > /etc/resolv.conf

# DHCP config for eth0
auto eth0
iface eth0 inet dhcp

# Static config for eth1
auto eth1
iface eth1 inet static
        address 192.168.10.2
        netmask 255.255.255.0
#       gateway 192.168.10.1
#       up echo nameserver 192.168.10.1 > /etc/resolv.conf

# DHCP config for eth1
#auto eth1
#iface eth1 inet dhcp
```

#### Device's Configuration

Enabling ssh and connect to a network device manually and retrieve its configuration required for Ansible to configure devices remotely. This manual connection also establishes the authenticity of the network device, adding its RSA key fingerprint to your list of known hosts. (If you have connected to the device before, you have already established its authenticity.)

##### SW1 Configuration

```console
enable
!
conf terminal
!
hostname SW-1
!
ip domain-name tech.com
!
crypto key generate rsa modulus 1024
!
username admin password cisco
!
username admin pri 15
!
line vty 0 4
 transport input ssh
 login local
!
interface vlan 1
 no shutdown
 ip address 192.168.10.10 255.255.255.0
!
exit
!
end
!
wr
```

##### R1 Configuration

```console
enable
!
conf terminal
!
hostname R-1
!
ip domain-name tech.com
!
crypto key generate rsa general-keys modulus 1024
!
username admin password cisco
!
username admin pri 15
!
line vty 0 4
 transport input ssh
 login local
!
interface fastEthernet 0/0
 ip add 192.168.10.20 255.255.255.0
 no sh
!
exit
!
end
!
wr
```

##### R2 Configuration

```console
enable
!
conf terminal
!
hostname R-2
!
ip domain-name tech.com
!
crypto key generate rsa general-keys modulus 1024
!
username admin password cisco
!
username admin pri 15
!
line vty 0 4
 transport input ssh
 login local
!
interface fastEthernet 0/1
 ip add 192.168.10.30 255.255.255.0
 no sh
!
exit
!
end
!
wr
```

## [Introduction to ad-hoc commands](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/intro_adhoc.html#introduction-to-ad-hoc-commands)

An Ansible ad hoc command uses the /usr/bin/ansible command-line tool to automate a single task on one or more managed nodes. ad hoc commands are quick and easy, but they are not reusable.

### [Run Your First Network Ansible Ad-hoc Command](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.9/network/getting_started/first_playbook.html#id5)

Instead of manually connecting and running a command on the network device, you can retrieve its configuration with a single, stripped-down Ansible command as below:

```json
root@NetworkAutomation-1:~# ansible all -i 192.168.10.10, -c network_cli -u admin -k -m ping -e ansible_network_os=ios
SSH password: 
192.168.10.10 | SUCCESS => {
    "ansible_facts": {
        "discovered_interpreter_python": "/usr/bin/python3"
    },
    "changed": false,
    "ping": "pong"
}
```

The flags in this command set seven values:

- the host group(s) to which the command should apply (in this case, all)

- the inventory (-i, the device or devices to target - without the trailing comma -i points to an inventory file)

- the connection method (-c, the method for connecting and executing ansible)

- the user (-u, the username for the SSH connection)

- the SSH connection method (-k, please prompt for the password)

- the module (-m, the ansible module to run)

- an extra variable ( -e, in this case, setting the network OS value)

### Raw module in Ansible

The raw module is the module that doesn’t translate our  commands and Ansible purley transfer our commands on remote devices via ssh. The raw module is mainly used for monitoring and troubleshooting and not for configuration.

#### Ansible raw module syntax

```json
root@NetworkAutomation-1:~# ansible all -i 192.168.10.10, -u admin -m raw -a "sh ver" -k

We probably don’t want to see every line of the output from “show version” command. So we can use grep, to filter, the name of the device and also the version.

```json
root@NetworkAutomation-1:~# ansible all -i 192.168.10.10, -u admin -m raw -a "sh ver" -k | grep "CHANGED\|Version"
SSH password: 
192.168.10.10 | CHANGED | rc=0 >>

> One more example:

```json
