## Introduction
A vagrant is a tool for building and managing virtual machine environments in a single workflow. With an easy-to-use workflow and focus on automation, Vagrant lowers development environment setup time, increases production parity, and makes the "works on my machine" excuse a relic of the past.

In this blog, I'm showing you how to use Vagrant on Ubuntu machines.

### Requirement of the lab

1. Install the [Vagrant](https://www.vagrantup.com/downloads) software on your machine.

2. Install [Virtualbox](https://www.virtualbox.org/), the default provider for Vagrant.

### Installation

I'm installing [Centos 7](https://app.vagrantup.com/centos/boxes/7) box for demonstration, but the procedure is the same for any other box. Create a folder/directory on your machine named my-lab. Open your terminal and navigate to the specific folder.

Initialize the Vagrant to create a Vagrantfile as below.

```console
[$] <> vagrant init centos/7
A `Vagrantfile` has been placed in this directory. You are now
ready to `vagrant up` your first virtual environment! Please read
the comments in the Vagrantfile as well as documentation on
`vagrantup.com` for more information on using Vagrant.
```

```console
[$] <> vagrant up
Bringing machine 'default' up with 'virtualbox' provider...
==> default: Box 'centos/7' could not be found. Attempting to find and install...
    default: Box Provider: virtualbox
    default: Box Version: >= 0

    default: SSH address: 127.0.0.1:2222
    default: SSH username: vagrant
    default: SSH auth method: private key
    default: 
    default: Vagrant insecure key detected. Vagrant will automatically replace
    default: this with a newly generated keypair for better security.
    default: 
    default: Inserting generated public key within guest...
    default: Removing insecure key from the guest if it's present...
    default: Key inserted! Disconnecting and reconnecting using new SSH key...
==> default: Machine booted and ready!
==> default: Checking for guest additions in VM...
    default: No guest additions were detected on the base box for this VM! Guest
    default: additions are required for forwarded ports, shared folders, host only
    default: networking, and more. If SSH fails on this machine, please install
    default: the guest additions and repackage the box to continue.
    default: 
    default: This is not an error message; everything may continue to work properly,
    default: in which case you may ignore this message.
==> default: Rsyncing folder: /home/syd/my-lab/ => /vagrant
```

Now Your Vagrant box is up and running. You can check the status of the Vagrant box as below with the _vagrant status_ command:

```console
[$] <> vagrant status
Current machine states:

default                   running (virtualbox)

The VM is running. To stop this VM, you can run `vagrant halt` to
shut it down forcefully, or you can run `vagrant suspend` to simply
suspend the virtual machine. In either case, to restart it again,
simply run `vagrant up`.
```

SSH into this machine with _vagrant ssh_, and explore your environment. Leave the SSH session with logout and shutdown with _vagrant halt_ command.

For more information see the quick start guide on the official [website](https://www.vagrantup.com/intro).
